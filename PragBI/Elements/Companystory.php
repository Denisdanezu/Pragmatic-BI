        <br>
        <p>I started working with IT in 1990. I started with very technical programming and then later included consulting to my skills. Over time I started changing my focus and I started working with BI. First with small amounts of data and over time it increased. </p>
        <p>After 23 years in the industry, including 12 years of consulting, I decided I wanted to start Pragmatic BI - a place where I can fully control the level of quality and service.</p>
