        <p>Data Warehouses don’t have to be complicated. With a pragmatic starting point, I work with designs, often based on dimensional modelled data warehouses. I base it on Kimball’s ideas on data warehouse architecture.</p>
        <p>To avoid explaining this abstractly, I work with the concept data warehouse “Pegasus Park”, which, with a minimum of data can display the principles I will base my work on.</p>
        <p>“Pegasus Park” includes everything from a data source, over data consolidating, dimensional modelling and DataMart.</p>
        <p>This means a teaching or demonstrations of data warehouse technologies never has a theoretical approach; you will experience a demo and hands-on opportunities.</p>
